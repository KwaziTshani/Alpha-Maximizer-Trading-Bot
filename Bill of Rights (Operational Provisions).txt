Procedural
stage – standing
(locus standi)

Enforcement of rights

Anyone listed in this section has the right to approach
a competent court, alleging that a right in the Bill of
Rights has been infringed or threatened, and the court
may grant appropriate relief, including a declaration of
rights. The persons who may approach a court are(a) anyone acting in their own interest;
(b)anyone acting on behalf of another person who
cannot act in their own name;
(c)anyone acting as a member of, or in the interest of, a
group or class of persons;
(d) anyone acting in the public interest; and
(e) an association acting in the interest of its members.

Who bears
the rights in
the Bill of
Rights

Consider the wording of the right in the Bill
of Rights: “everyone” (sometimes phrased
in the negative “no one may be…”),
“citizen”, “adult citizen”, “worker”,
“employer”, child”, “everyone who is
arrested”, “everyone who is detained” etc

Section 8(4): “A juristic person is entitled to
the rights in the Bill of Rights to the extent
required by the nature of the rights and the
nature of that juristic person”

Who is
bound by the
Bill of Rights

• Always binding on the state
• Private persons / juristic persons: “it
depends”

• Section 8(2)
• “A provision of the Bill of Rights binds a natural
or a juristic person if, and to the extent that, it is
applicable, taking into account the nature of the
right and the nature of any duty imposed by the
right”.

Direct and
indirect
application
of the Bill of
Rights

• Direct application

• Striking down legislation as unconstitutional
• Striking down common law / customary law
as unconstitutional

• Indirect application

• Develop the common law / customary law to
conform to the Constitution
• Section 39(2)
• Eg Masiya judgment (textbook p183)

• In private disputes (state not involved), very little practical
difference between direct and indirect application

Direct and
indirect
application
of the Bill of
Rights

8(2) A provision of the Bill of Rights binds a natural or a juristic person
if, and to the extent that, it is applicable, taking into account the
nature of the right and the nature of any duty imposed by the right.
(3) When applying a provision of the Bill of Rights to a natural or
juristic person in terms of subsection (2), a court- (a)
in order to
give effect to a right in the Bill, must apply, or if necessary develop, the
common law to the extent that legislation does not give effect to that
right…
versus
39 (2)
When interpreting any legislation, and when developing the
common law or customary law, every court, tribunal or forum must
promote the spirit, purport and objects of the Bill of Rights.

Vertical and
horizontal
application
of the Bill of
Rights

• Vertical application

• Section 8(1)
• State is bound by the BoR

• Horizontal application

• Section 8(2) and 8(3)
• Private persons bound by the BoR

• First consider if legislation exists that concretises
the specific right in the BoR

Application
of the BoR:
Subsidiarity

• If so, apply the legislation (unless the legislation is
itself unconstitutional; then first bring a case to
court to challenge the legislation)
• Example: Section 9(4) of the Constitution versus the
Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair
Discrimination Act 4 of 2000
• If no legislation exists, then apply the Constitution,
for example by arguing that the common law must
be developed
